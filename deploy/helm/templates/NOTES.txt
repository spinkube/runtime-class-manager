Welcome to Runtime-Class-Manager.

Next steps:

Create one or more Wasm Shim custom resources. See the samples in https://github.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager/tree/main/config/samples.

> Note: Ensure that the `location` for the specified shim binary points to the correct architecture for your Node(s)

For example, install the Spin shim:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager/refs/heads/main/config/samples/test_shim_spin.yaml
```

Next, annotate one or more nodes with a label corresponding to the `nodeSelector` declared in the Shim, runtime-class-manager will install the shim as well as create the corresponding RuntimeClass:

```shell
kubectl label node --all spin=true
```

You are now ready to deploy your Wasm workloads.
